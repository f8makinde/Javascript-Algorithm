Basic javascript algorithm

Problem 1
Write a function that can solve the following mathematical problem:

- Area of a rectangle = length * width
-  Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * ( length + width )


for example, given;
 length= 4
 width = 2

 Area of the rectangle = 8
 perimeter of the rectangle= 12


 Problem 2
 Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.

convertToF(0) should return a number

convertToF(-30) should return a value of -22

convertToF(-10) should return a value of 14

convertToF(0) should return a value of 32

convertToF(20) should return a value of 68

convertToF(30) should return a value of 86


Problem 3
Solving quardratic equation

From the quadratic equation form and formula below, we can easily solve quadratic problems.
ax² + bx + c = 0
x = -b ± √(b²-4ac)/2a

For example:
2x² – 5x + 3 = 0
where a= 2, b=-5 and c=3
implementing these 3 arguments into the function respectively, the root of the equation will be 3/2 and 1.

For 2x² + x – 300 = 0 the root of the equation will be 12 and -12.5.

For  x² + 4x - 5=0 the root of the equation will be -5 and 1.


Problem 4

I learnt about array manipulation and I was able to solve some basic algorithms on it.

Algorithm question:

In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Write a queue function which takes an array and a number as arguments.
Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.
The queue function should then return the new array formed

Test:
queue([5,6,7,8,9], 1) should return [6,7,8,9,1]
queue([0,4,5,2], 10) should return [4,5,2,10]

Problem 5

I was able to do some personal practice on array manipulation just to master the basics.

The function below takes out the first element of an array and the last element from an array of numbers and sum the elements together. The result of the manipulated array will be the summed element coming as the first element of the array followed by the remaining element in that array.

for example:

[1,2,3,4,5] = [6,2,3,4]
[3,4,2,5]= [8,4,2]
[2,3,5,6,10,1] = [3,3,5,6,10]
