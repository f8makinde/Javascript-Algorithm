Basic javascript algorithm

Problem 1
Write a function that can solve the following mathematical problem:

- Area of a rectangle = length * width
-  Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 * ( length + width )


for example, given;
 length= 4
 width = 2

 Area of the rectangle = 8
 perimeter of the rectangle= 12


 Problem 2
 Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.

convertToF(0) should return a number

convertToF(-30) should return a value of -22

convertToF(-10) should return a value of 14

convertToF(0) should return a value of 32

convertToF(20) should return a value of 68

convertToF(30) should return a value of 86


Problem 3
Solving quardratic equation

From the quadratic equation form and formula below, we can easily solve quadratic problems.
ax² + bx + c = 0
x = -b ± √(b²-4ac)/2a

For example:
2x² – 5x + 3 = 0
where a= 2, b=-5 and c=3
implementing these 3 arguments into the function respectively, the root of the equation will be 3/2 and 1.

For 2x² + x – 300 = 0 the root of the equation will be 12 and -12.5.

For  x² + 4x - 5=0 the root of the equation will be -5 and 1.
