Problem 31

Problem Statement: Given an array of size n, write a program to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order or not. If the array is sorted then return True, Else return False.
Example: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 
[8, 3, 4, 9]

Problem 32

Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by one place.


Problem 33

Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, rotating array of elements by k elements either left or right.

Example 1:
Input: N = 7, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} , k=2 , right
Output: 6 7 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: array is rotated to right by 2 position .

Example 2:
Input: N = 6, array[] = {3,7,8,9,10,11} , k=3 , left 
Output: 9 10 11 3 7 8
Explanation: Array is rotated to right by 3 position.


Problem 34

Problem Statement: Given an array, and an element num the task is to find if num is present in the given array or not. If present return the index of the element or return -1.

Example 1:
Input: arr[]= 1 2 3 4 5, num = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is present in the 2nd index

Example 2:
Input: arr[]= 5 4 3 2 1, num = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: 5 is present in the 0th index

 Problem 46
  * Write your own `filter` function! Don't worry about adding it to the prototype of arrays or anything.
 * This function should take 2 parameters:
 * 1. The array you want to filter through, and
 * 2. A callback function
 * 
 * Steps for filterArray function logic:
 * 1. Initialize a new, empty array which will be returned at the end of the `filterArray`s operations (Completed âœ…)
 * 2. Loop through the array passed as the 1st parameter
 * 3. Inside the loop, call the callback function, passing the individual item you're currently looping over as the argument to your callback function
 * 4. If the callback function returns `true`, push the current item you're iterating on in the loop to the new array. If it returns `false`, don't push it to the array.
 * 5. When the loop is over, return the new array
